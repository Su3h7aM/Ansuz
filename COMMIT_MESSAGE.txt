Refactor: Simplify to pure immediate mode rendering

Simplified the Ansuz TUI library by removing double buffering and dirty
tracking in favor of full-frame rendering each frame. This makes the
library much simpler to understand and maintain while keeping 100% API
compatibility.

Key changes:

1. Buffer System (ansuz/buffer.odin):
   - Removed `dirty` field from Cell struct
   - Removed `clear_dirty_flags()` function
   - Removed `cells_equal()` function
   - Removed `render_diff()` function (no longer needed)
   - Simplified `set_cell()` - no change detection
   - Simplified `clear_buffer()` - no dirty marking

2. API (ansuz/api.odin):
   - Changed Context from double buffer to single buffer
   - Simplified `begin_frame()` - just clears buffer
   - Simplified `end_frame()` - renders full buffer every frame
   - Updated all drawing functions to use single buffer

3. Documentation:
   - Updated README.md to reflect pure immediate mode
   - Added IMMEDIATE_MODE_REFACTOR.md with technical details
   - Added CHANGES_SUMMARY.md with overview
   - Added TESTING.md with testing procedures
   - Updated .gitignore for build artifacts

Benefits:
- ~60 lines of code removed
- 3 functions removed
- Simpler mental model (no hidden state)
- True immediate mode pattern
- Easier to debug and maintain
- No breaking changes to public API

Testing:
- All unit tests pass (3/3)
- Both examples compile successfully
- No references to removed code in codebase

The visual output and functionality remain identical. Performance is
still more than adequate for typical TUI applications. The tradeoff
of full-frame rendering is worth it for the significant simplification.
